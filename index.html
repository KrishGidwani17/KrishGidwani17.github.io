        <h4>Breakdown of My Apartments Elevator Interface:</h4>

        <!-- Analyzing my elevator interface-->

        <p style="line-height: 2">
            The previous picture is an example of an elevator control interface found in my apartment complex. <br>This elevator panel does end up getting the job done however it does have some design problems that I have noticed. 
        </p>

        <h5>Issues With This Design:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Random placement of push buttons, and key inserts</li>
            <li>Unnecessary use of space -> this panel is unnecessarily long</li>
            <li>The display at the very top of the elevator doesn’t display any relevant information</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Positives With This Design:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>Gets the job done</li>
            <li>Button Labels Are Clear</li>
            <li>Includes open/close buttons</li>
            <li>emergency buttons</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Summary of This Elevator Interface</h5>

        <p style="line-height: 2">Overall, I would describe this interface by saying "It gets the job done" <br>There are no outstanding qualities of this elevator as it has basic features alot of elevators have <br>It does however have soem inconsistencies in its designs that make it have an overall decent design</p>

        <h4>What Makes Up an Elevator</h4>

        <h5>Common Features of an Elevator Pannel</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Buttons to select floors</li>
            <li>Open and close buttons</li>
            <li>Display saying what floor you are on</li>
            <li>Arrows signifying going up or going down</li>
            <li>Emergency buttons</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Rare Features of an Elevator Pannel</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Information about today like date or time</li>
            <li>Touch screen interface</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 2"> Overall, these features do make doing everyday features in an elevator very simple to use if they are implemented correctly </p>


        <h5>Common Sequence of Actions When Using an Elevator</h5>

        <ol>
            <li>User walks into elevator</li>
            <li>User scans through buttons to select floor, and chooses desired floor</li>
            <li>User waits for doors to close, or presses a "close door" button</li>
            <li>User gets to desired floor and walks out</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>How Does an Elevator Support the User?</h5>

        <p style="line-height: 2">
            The elevator usually supports the user by providing icons for what each button does, these icons are usually next to the button or on top of the button. Usually, the use of an elevator is very intuitive and if the panel is designed well this is a quick process to figure out how an elevator works. 
        </p>

        <h5>How Does an Elevator Provide Feedback to the User:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>When a button is pressed the button lights up signifying a push</li>
            <li>When doors open or close there is audible “ding”</li>
            <li>As you pass floors, if there is a display the display manually changes based on what floor you are passing</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Common Mistakes with Current Elevators:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Mistakenly selecting the wrong floor due to button layout</li>
            <li>If there are multiple stops for an elevator, some people get off at the wrong floor as there is no information to tell them what floor you have arrived on</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Improvements to Current Design:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Touch screen display allowing user to input what floor they would like to go to</li>
            <li>Modern design with minimal colors</li>
            <li>Colored button for highlighted features -> red for emergency buttons, green for confirming actions</li>
            <li>Display giving information about time, and date</li>
            <li>Display those changes based on what floor the user is on</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- My Sketch -->

        <h4>My Proposed Sketch of an Improved Elevator Pannel Interface</h4>

        <p>Sketch Goes Here</p>

        <p style="line-height: 2">My sketch in cooperates all the previous notes on how I think an elevator interface can be made. I have decided to go with a flat face that could be embedded into the elevator, this also allows for a touch screen display. </p>

        <h5>The features that I’ve implemented in my sketch is:</h5>

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>Clean modern design</li>
            <li>Touch screen-design</li>
            <li>Total screen size of 12’’ by 24’’</li>
            <li>Button feedback -> change in color of the touch screen button and possible haptic feedback</li>
            <li>Today view at the top to let user know about what’s going on today</li>
            <li>Current floor indicator</li>
            <li>Open/Close buttons</li>
            <li>Emergency buttons -> highlighted in red</li>
            <li>Consistent color usage</li>
        </ul>
